# somescripts
Some shell scripts and tools for every day.

This repository contains several tools I have put together to simplify my
everyday Linux experience. They are intended as a starting point for you, 
their quality, security, stability may vary.

# Wmd
Wmd is a R Markdown variant. When installing all the files (or the Debian /
Ubuntu package), you can write an Wmd file everywhere you are on your computer
and invoke the wmd command to compile it to HTML. Additionally to
R markdown provided by knitr, it provides a syntax for Twitter tweet links as
well as a shortcut for embedded figures with caption. But, mainly, it allows
you to use R markdown with caching and with auto-detection of changed files from
command line with a single command `wmd`.
